I tried to combine the mechanics of Roll-A-Ball as well as of Mission Demolition to create my version of pinball. 
From Roll-A-Ball, I took the concept of collectible PickUps and from Mission demolition, I used Projectiles as a player object.

To play, the player uses the cylinder at the bottom of the pin ball machine to sling balls around the play area. Avoiding the obstacles, or using them to bounce off of,
The player must collect all of the PickUps to win the game. 

I tired to follow the MDA framework because my idea came with the combination of the mechanics of other games. The dynamics came with making sure the physics worked properly
and finally the goal for my aesthetic was "pinball" which I tried to simulate with the neon "arcade"-esque color palette.
